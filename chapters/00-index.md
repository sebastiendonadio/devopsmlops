## Overview

This book takes a DevOps approach to MLOps and uniquely positions how MLOps is an extension of well-established DevOps principles using real-world use cases. It leverages multiple DevOps concepts and methodologies such as CI/CD and software testing. It also demonstrates the additional concepts from MLOps such as continuous training that expands CI/CD/CT to build, operationalize and monitor ML models. 

* **Beginner-friendly yet comprehensive**. From the very basics of programming up to front-end and back-end web development, a lot of topics are covered in a simple and approachable way. No prior knowledge needed!
* **Easy to follow**. Code along directly in your browser or build an efficient JavaScript development environment on your local machine.
