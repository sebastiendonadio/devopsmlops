abstract: |
  This book takes a DevOps approach to MLOps and uniquely positions how MLOps is an extension of well-established DevOps principles using real-world use cases. It leverages multiple DevOps concepts and methodologies such as CI/CD and software testing. It also demonstrates the additional concepts from MLOps such as continuous training that expands CI/CD/CT to build, operationalize and monitor ML models.
